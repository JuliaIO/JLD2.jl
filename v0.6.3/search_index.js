The @load macro loads variables out of a JLD2 file:\n\n@load \"example.jld2\" hello foo\n\nThis assigns the contents of the hello and foo datasets to variables of the same name in the current scope.\n\nIt is best practice to explicitly name the variables to be loaded and saved from a file, so that it is clear from whence these variables arise.

When called with no variable arguments, @save <filename> writes all variables in the global scope of the current module to file <filename>, while @load <filename> loads all variables in file <filename>.
