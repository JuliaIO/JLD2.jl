# Phase 2 Complete: Single Chunk Index Reading

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

## Summary

Successfully implemented Single Chunk Index (Type 1) reading for DataLayout v4 in JLD2. Both unfiltered and filtered (compressed) single chunk datasets can now be read correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed DataLayout Message Parsing in `src/headermessages.jl`

**Issue**: The `data_address` field was not being read from the file for v4 chunked layouts.

**Root cause**: Line 147 had `data_address::RelOffset = UNDEFINED_ADDRESS` which set a default value instead of reading from the file.

**Fix**: Removed the default value assignment:
```julia
# Before
data_address::RelOffset = UNDEFINED_ADDRESS

# After
data_address::RelOffset
```

### 2. Fixed Conditional Fields for Single Chunk Indexing in `src/headermessages.jl`

**Issue**: The `data_size` and `filters` fields were always being read for Single Chunk indexing (type 1), but according to the HDF5 spec, these fields should only exist when the chunk is filtered (flags & 0x02 is set).

**Root cause**: Line 128 had `if chunk_indexing_type == 1` without checking the flags field.

**Fix**: Added flag check to the conditional:
```julia
# Before
if chunk_indexing_type == 1 # Single Chunk
    data_size::@Int(8) = 0
    filters::UInt32 = 0
end

# After
if chunk_indexing_type == 1 && isset(flags, 1) # Single Chunk with filters
    data_size::@Int(8) = 0
    filters::UInt32 = 0
end
```

**Impact**: This fix allowed the parser to correctly read the `data_address` field which immediately follows the optional `data_size` and `filters` fields.

### 3. Fixed DataLayout Construction in `src/datalayouts.jl`

**Issue**: The DataLayout constructor tried to access `msg.data_size` and `msg.filters` without checking if the chunk was filtered.

**Root cause**: Line 80 unconditionally accessed these fields for type 1 indexing.

**Fix**: Added conditional access based on flags:
```julia
# Before
indexing_info = if chunk_indexing_type == 1
    SingleChunkInfo(UInt64(msg.data_size), msg.filters)

# After
indexing_info = if chunk_indexing_type == 1
    is_filtered = (msg.flags & 0x02) != 0
    data_size = is_filtered ? UInt64(msg.data_size) : UInt64(0)
    filters = is_filtered ? msg.filters : UInt32(0)
    SingleChunkInfo(data_size, filters)
```

**Also fixed**: Line 101 which used `isdefined()` (which never works on header message objects per project guidelines):
```julia
# Before
data_length = chunk_indexing_type == 1 && isdefined(msg, :data_size) ? Int64(msg.data_size) : Int64(0)

# After
data_length = chunk_indexing_type == 1 && (msg.flags & 0x02) != 0 ? Int64(msg.data_size) : Int64(0)
```

## Test Results

All Single Chunk test files now read correctly:

| File | Dataset | Filtered | Status |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| test_v4_single_chunk.h5 | v4_single | No | ✅ PASSED |
| test_v4_filtered_single.h5 | v4_filtered | Yes (gzip) | ✅ PASSED |

**Verification**:
```bash
# Unfiltered single chunk
julia --project -e 'using JLD2; data = jldopen("test_v4_single_chunk.h5") do f; f["v4_single"]; end; println(data)'
# Output: 4x5 array with values 0-19 ✓

# Filtered single chunk
julia --project -e 'using JLD2; data = jldopen("test_v4_filtered_single.h5") do f; f["v4_filtered"]; end; println(data)'
# Output: 10x10 array with values 0-99 ✓
```

## What Works Now

✅ DataLayout v4 parsing for all chunk indexing types
✅ Single Chunk Index (Type 1) data reading - unfiltered
✅ Single Chunk Index (Type 1) data reading - filtered/compressed
✅ Correct data_address field parsing
✅ Proper handling of optional fields based on flags

## What Doesn't Work Yet

❌ Fixed Array Index (Type 3) - reading not implemented
❌ Extensible Array Index (Type 4) - reading not implemented
❌ V2 B-tree Index (Type 5) - reading not implemented
❌ Implicit Index (Type 2) - not tested
❌ Writing DataLayout v4 files

These will be addressed in subsequent phases.

## Key Insights

### HDF5 Format Details

1. **DataLayout v4 Structure for Single Chunk**:
   ```
   - version (1 byte) = 4
   - layout_class (1 byte) = 2 (LcChunked)
   - flags (1 byte)
   - dimensionality (1 byte)
   - dim_size (1 byte)
   - dimensions (dimensionality * dim_size bytes)
   - chunk_indexing_type (1 byte) = 1
   - [OPTIONAL] data_size (8 bytes) - only if flags & 0x02
   - [OPTIONAL] filters (4 bytes) - only if flags & 0x02
   - data_address (8 bytes) - ALWAYS present
   ```

2. **Flags field (byte 3 of DataLayout message)**:
   - Bit 0: Reserved
   - Bit 1 (0x02): Dataset is filtered (compressed/transformed)
   - Other bits: Reserved

3. **Single Chunk Indexing**:
   - Used when dataset fits in exactly one chunk
   - data_address points directly to chunk data in file
   - If filtered, chunk data is compressed; data_size indicates compressed size
   - If not filtered, chunk data is raw; no size field needed (can be calculated from dataspace)

### Debugging Process

1. **Used h5debug to find actual data location**:
   - Showed "Index address: 2048" for single chunk file
   - Compared with JLD2 output showing "data_address: RelOffset(0)"

2. **Examined raw file bytes**:
   - Read bytes at DataLayout message offset
   - Decoded structure byte-by-byte
   - Found data_address was at bytes 15-22, contained value 0x0800 (2048)

3. **Root cause analysis**:
   - Parser was reading data_size/filters for ALL type 1 chunks
   - This shifted subsequent field reads by 12 bytes
   - data_address was being read from wrong position, getting 0

4. **Fix verification**:
   - After flag check fix, data_address correctly parsed as RelOffset(2048)
   - Data reading then worked correctly for both filtered and unfiltered cases

### @pseudostruct Behavior

- Fields without `= value` are always read from file
- Fields with `= value` use that as default for writing, but still read when reading
- Conditional fields (`if condition ... end`) only read/write when condition is true
- **Never use `isdefined()` on header message objects** - it always returns false
- Use flag checks or field access with conditional logic instead

## Files Modified

- `src/headermessages.jl` - Fixed DataLayout v4 field parsing (lines 128, 147)
- `src/datalayouts.jl` - Fixed SingleChunkInfo construction (lines 78-83, 101)

## Performance

Single Chunk reading performance is optimal:
- Direct seek to chunk data address
- Single read operation (or decompress operation if filtered)
- No index structure traversal needed

Comparable to contiguous storage for single-chunk datasets.

## Next Steps

**Phase 3**: Implement Fixed Array Index reading (6-8 hours)
- Parse Fixed Array header structure
- Read chunk address array
- Implement chunk lookup
- Test with test_v4_fixed_array.h5 (30×10 array, 3×2 chunks)

See `CHUNK_INDEXING_ANALYSIS.md` for complete roadmap.
