# Custom Serialization (Experimental)

Version `v0.3.0` of introduces support for custom serialization.
For now this feature is considered experimental as it passes tests but 
has little testing in the wild. â†’ Please test and report if you encounter problems.

The API is simple enough, to enable custom serialization for your type `A` you define
a new type e.g. `ASerialization` that contains the fields you want to store and define
`JLD2.writeas(::Type{A}) = ASerialization`.
Internally JLD2 will call `Base.convert` when writing and loading, so you need to make sure to extend that for your type.

```julia
struct A
    x::Int
end

struct ASerialization
    x::Vector{Int}
end

JLD2.writeas(::Type{A}) = ASerialization
Base.convert(::Type{ASerialization}, a::A) = ASerialization([a.x])
Base.convert(::Type{A}, a::ASerialization) = A(only(a.x))
```

!!! warning "Already defined custom serialization"
    Take care, some Julia internal types already use a `CustomSerialization` and JLD2.jl cannot nest them.
    In order to avoid unexpected behavior you should define a wrapper type,
    such as in the example above `ASerialization` even if you could use a simple Julia built in type (as in this case `Vector{Int}`).
    
If you do not want to overload `Base.convert` then you can also define

```julia
JLD2.wconvert(::Type{ASerialization}, a::A) = ASerialization([a.x])
JLD2.rconvert(::Type{A}, a::ASerialization) = A(only(a.x))
```

instead. This may be particularly relevant when types are involved that are not your own.

```julia
struct B
    x::Float64
end

JLD2.writeas(::Type{B}) = Float64
JLD2.wconvert(::Type{Float64}, b::B) = b.x
JLD2.rconvert(::Type{B}, x::Float64) = B(x)

arr = [B(rand()) for i=1:10]

@save "test.jld2" arr
```

In this example JLD2 converts the array of `B` structs to a plain `Vector{Float64}` prior to 
storing to disk.
